## Overview

This Individual Continuous Assessment (ICA) requires you to design and implement a **small, contained escape-room micro-experience** using **Unreal Engine**.

The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate your **craft**: how effectively you apply environment design, materials, lighting, interaction logic, feedback, and iteration to produce a **polished, playable experience** within a constrained scope.

This is **not** an assessment of scale, asset quantity, or feature count. A small, coherent, well-crafted experience will score higher than a large but unfinished one.

All work must demonstrate **environmental storytelling** and **storytelling through materials**.

## Escape Room Definition

An *escape room* in the context of this ICA is defined as:

- A **single, contained environment**.
- A clear starting state where the player **cannot leave**.
- A clear end state where the **exit becomes available**.
- A short **investigative arc** where the player explores, learns, and solves a mechanical puzzle to escape.

This experience should focus on **observation, interaction, and cause and effect**, not combat, jump scares, or extended narrative sequences.

## Narrative Structure 

Your escape room must follow a simple three-beat narrative structure:

- **Confusion** — The player begins locked in the space with limited context.
- **Insight** — Examination and interaction reveal meaning, clues, or relationships.
- **Resolution** — The final discovery or alignment enables escape.

Narrative is communicated **through the environment**, not through cutscenes or elaborate dialogue trees.

## Interaction System

You must implement **only** the following three interaction verbs. No additional verbs or interaction types are required.

| Verb | Definition | Minimum requirements (all must be present) |
| :- | :- | :- |
| **Examine** | The player inspects an object to gain information. | **UI:** title + short description.<br>**Audio:** examination SFX.<br>**Camera:** one behaviour (e.g., focus shift, push-in, or cinematic cut). |
| **Collect** | The player takes an object into inventory for later use. | **Inventory:** add item to inventory.<br>**World:** remove or clearly mark as collected.<br>**Audio:** collection SFX.<br>**Feedback:** one line of player feedback (subtitle/self-talk). |
| **Modify** | The player changes the state of the world. | **State:** visible world-state change.<br>**Gating:** at least one Modify is gated by prior Examine or Collect.<br>**Feedback:** clear visual + audio feedback (e.g., Niagara + sound + light change). |

## Mechanical Puzzle 

| Requirement | Description |
| :- | :- |
| Puzzle elements | Minimum of **three** distinct physical elements |
| Spatial layout | Elements must be **physically separated** |
| Player movement | Player must move between elements to solve |
| Completion | Solved puzzle **unlocks the escape** |

The puzzle elements are only **solved** by the player by examining clue props in the room.

## Environment & Asset Constraints 

| Constraint | Requirement |
| :- | :- |
| Asset source | Up to **5 free asset packs** (total) from the Unreal or Unity Asset Store |
| References | Grounded in **real-world environment design** |
| Storytelling | Evident through layout, props, lighting, and materials |



## Required Unreal Engine Features 

| Requirement | What you must do | Typical examples |
| :- | :- | :- |
| **Custom Substrate material** | Create **at least one student-authored Substrate material** that is **unique** (not off-the-shelf or trivially modified) and supports **storytelling-through-materials**. | Rust + residue + clear-coat wear, damp stone with mineral streaking, painted metal with chipped edges revealing primer, etc. |
| **Niagara VFX** | Use **at least one meaningful Niagara effect** that supports atmosphere or gameplay feedback. | Dust motes, energy flow, sparks, steam bursts on puzzle actions, state-based glow/mist. |
| **Camera sequence** | Use a short **camera sequence** tied to progression. | Puzzle solved reveal, exit unlocking moment, discovery reveal, alignment completion. |

## Staged Development & Gated Feedback

This ICA is delivered in **two stages**. Stages 1 is a **mandatory gate** but it is **not graded**.

| Stage | Week | What you submit | Purpose |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
| **Stage 1 — Concept & References** | **8** | Environment identity + intent; real-world references; planned puzzle structure; asset pack choice + justification. | Confirm scope, references, and plan before building. |
| **Stage 2 — Final Submission** | **15** | Polished puzzle end-to-end; core interactions (3 verbs); lighting, camera, and material requirements. Complete experience + docs. | Assess craft, quality, and learning evidence. |

## Assessment Breakdown 

| Component | Marks | What we’re looking for |
| :- | :- | :- |
| **A. Technical Execution** | **40** | Complete playable escape loop; correct verb implementation; robust puzzle logic and feedback; effective use of Niagara and camera sequence; basic performance awareness. |
| **B. Environmental & Material Storytelling** | **20** | Environment communicates story through layout/props/lighting; custom Substrate material is unique, purposeful, and clearly showcased. |
| **C. Creativity** | **15** | Original interpretation and strong identity within constraints; thoughtful aesthetic and interaction choices. |
| **D. Playability** | **15** | Clarity of goals and feedback; readable puzzle logic; reliable win path with no dead ends or broken states. |
| **E. Process & Professional Practice** | **10** | Repository use and commit quality; tidy organisation; evidence of iterative progress across stages. |

Replace <StudentName> with your own name as it appears on the class register.

**Duration:** 8–10 minutes

| Required screencast content | Notes |
| :- | :- |
| Environment overview | State the intent and the story the space communicates. |
| Demonstrate Examine / Collect / Modify | Show UI + SFX + camera behaviour for Examine; inventory for Collect; gated state change for Modify. |
| Demonstrate the mechanical puzzle | Show movement between the three elements and the final unlock. |
| Showcase Substrate + Niagara + camera sequence | Explain how these support storytelling and feedback. |
| End with craft reflection | Briefly summarise the most important changes you made after **Stage 1** and why those changes improved quality/playability. |

> :warning: If missing or inaccessible, the ICA cannot be graded.

## Repository & README (MANDATORY)

Your repository must be named using the following format:

## Appendix A: Assessment Rubric

| Component | **E (Excellent)** | **VG (Very Good)** | **G (Good)** | **S (Satisfactory)** | **P / NS (Pass / Not Satisfactory)** |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| **Technical Execution (40)** | Fully functional escape loop; interactions and puzzle are robust, readable, and polished; strong feedback and stability throughout. | Escape loop fully functional with very minor issues; interactions and puzzle logic clear and well implemented. | Core systems work; minor bugs or clarity issues present but do not block progression. | Basic functionality present but fragile or inconsistent; noticeable issues in logic or feedback. | Incomplete or broken gameplay loop; missing required systems or severe technical faults. |
| **Environmental Storytelling (15)** | Environment clearly communicates story through layout, lighting, and prop placement; spatial design strongly supports the narrative arc. | Strong environmental storytelling with minor inconsistencies or missed opportunities. | Storytelling present but uneven; environment partially communicates intent. | Limited or generic environmental storytelling; weak narrative cues. | Little to no environmental storytelling evident. |
| **Substrate Material Quality (5)** | Custom Substrate material is unique, well-crafted, and meaningfully enhances storytelling through surface detail and variation. | Substrate material is clearly student-authored and supports narrative intent with minor issues. | Substrate material shows effort but is conservative or inconsistently applied. | Substrate material present but weakly connected to storytelling or poorly integrated. | Substrate material missing, trivial, or ineffective. |
| **Creativity (15)** | Distinct identity and confident interpretation within constraints; creative decisions significantly enhance the experience. | Clear creative intent with some distinctive ideas; identity well established. | Some original ideas present, though conservative or uneven. | Minimal originality; relies heavily on default assets and conventions. | No clear creative intent beyond basic assembly of assets. |
| **Playability (15)** | Goals are clear; feedback is strong; progression is smooth with no confusion or dead ends. | Generally very playable with only minor clarity or flow issues. | Playable but with noticeable clarity, feedback, or pacing issues. | Playable but confusing in places; weak signposting or feedback. | Difficult to play; unclear goals, broken progression, or dead ends present. |
| **Process (5)** | Clear evidence of iterative development across time; commits map to meaningful milestones and refinement. | Regular iteration with minor gaps; clear progression from early to final. | Some iteration evident but uneven or clustered; progression still visible. | Limited iteration; commits suggest late start or rushed development. | Little to no evidence of iterative process; single-dump or near-single-dump history. |
| **Professional Practice (5)** | Excellent repo organisation and naming; clear README; clean project structure; assets and sources well documented. | Well organised repo and documentation with minor issues; README mostly complete. | Adequate organisation; README present but may be unclear or incomplete in places. | Weak organisation or unclear documentation; README missing key required items. | Repo/README missing or inaccessible; naming and organisation prevent effective review. |
