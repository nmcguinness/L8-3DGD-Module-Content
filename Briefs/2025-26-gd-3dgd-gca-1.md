## Overview

This Group Continuous Assessment (GCA) requires each team to design, conduct, and report on **two rounds of user testing** for their game, then analyse the results and produce a written lab report.

The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate your ability to **plan a user study, collect and analyse playtest data, and communicate findings clearly**. Quality of insight and rigour of analysis matter more than the quantity of data collected.

All work must be **your own team's data**, collected during the designated in-class testing sessions in **Week 7** and **Week 11**.

## Report Requirements

Your report must follow the provided [Lab Report Template]([Lab_Report_Template.md](https://github.com/nmcguinness/L8-GD-IntroToStatisticalAnalysis-GD4A/blob/main/Report/Lab_Report_Template.md)) and the [Lab Report Sample](https://github.com/nmcguinness/L8-GD-IntroToStatisticalAnalysis-GD4A/blob/main/Report/Lab_Report_Sample.qmd).

**Word limit:** 2,000–3,000 words (excludes tables, figures, references, and appendices).

**Format:** Submit as a rendered HTML or PDF document produced from a Quarto (`.qmd`) source file. The source file must be included in your repository.

## Required Content

| Section | What it must contain |
| :- | :- |
| **Executive Summary** | Standalone 150–200 word summary of purpose, methods, key findings, and recommendations. Written last. |
| **Introduction** | Game context; scope of both testing sessions; 2–4 specific testing objectives; null and alternative hypotheses in plain English. |
| **Methodology** | Test design and approach; participant details (n, demographics, consent); materials and tools; step-by-step procedure for both sessions. |
| **Results** | Summary statistics table (n, mean/median, SD); at least one 95% confidence interval; at least one group comparison plot; correlation matrix for 3–5 key metrics; all figures captioned and referenced in text. |
| **Discussion** | Interpretation of findings linked to objectives; 3–5 key insights; honest statement of limitations. |
| **Conclusion** | Summary of findings; value to development; future considerations. |
| **References** | Consistent citation format (APA recommended). |
| **Appendices** | Raw data / analysis files; survey instrument; supplementary visualisations. |

## Minimum Requirements

Before submission, verify your report includes **all** of the following:

- [ ] Hypotheses (H₀/H₁) stated in plain English
- [ ] Summary table with n, mean/median, and spread for each group/build
- [ ] At least one 95% confidence interval reported in gameplay terms
- [ ] At least one group comparison plot (boxplot or equivalent)
- [ ] 2–4 total figures supporting your narrative
- [ ] Interpretation (2–4 sentences) for each major finding
- [ ] At least one concrete, evidence-backed recommendation
- [ ] Statement of exclusions and data cleaning decisions
- [ ] Correlation matrix for key numeric metrics
- [ ] Report within word limit

## Submission

Submit via the Moodle submission point. Your submission must include:

| Deliverable | Requirement |
| :- | :- |
| **Rendered report** | HTML or PDF, clearly named `2025-26-GD-3DGD-GCA-<TeamName>` |
| **Quarto source** | `.qmd` file used to produce the rendered report |
| **Data file(s)** | Spreadsheet(s) containing your collected data |

> :warning: A submission missing the rendered report or data files **cannot be graded**.
